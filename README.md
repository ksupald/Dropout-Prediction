## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict the likelihood of a student dropping out using historical and real-time data.
* Identify key risk factors such as attendance, grades, family background, and engagement levels.
* Provide automated and personalized counseling suggestions to at-risk students.
* Support counselors and administrators in making informed decisions.

---

## 🧠 Features

* 📊 **Student Risk Prediction**: ML model that categorizes students into risk levels (Low, Medium, High).
* 📥 **Data Input**: Admin panel to input student data like attendance, marks, behavior reports, etc.
* 📈 **Dashboard**: Visual representation of student risk profiles and statistics.
* 🧑‍⚕️ **Counseling Recommendations**: Automated suggestions for intervention and support.
* 🔐 **Role-based Access**: Admins, teachers, and counselors have different access permissions.
